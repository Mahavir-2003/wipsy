# Wipsy

## Introduction

Wipsy is a web-based platform designed to facilitate seamless note-taking, code sharing, and collaboration in educational or professional settings. It addresses the common challenge faced by students and professionals alike, where they often need to quickly capture and share their work or notes without the hassle of setting up accounts or dealing with authentication barriers.

### Problem Statement

In computer labs or practical sessions, students frequently encounter situations where they need to take notes, write code snippets, or capture outputs. However, traditional methods of note-taking and sharing can be cumbersome, especially when restricted from using email or messaging apps due to rules or connectivity issues.

### Solution

Wipsy offers a simple and intuitive solution by providing a notepad-like interface for creating temporary, shareable chats. These chats automatically get deleted after 24 hours, ensuring a clutter-free experience while maintaining privacy and security.

## Website URL

## How to Use

1. **Create a Chat ID**: Visit the Wipsy website and enter a unique chat ID or create a new one.
2. **Write or Upload Content**: Once you have a chat ID, you can start writing text, using Markdown syntax, creating code blocks, or uploading images directly into the input field.
3. **Share the Chat ID**: Share the chat ID with others who need access to the content. Anyone with the chat ID can view and contribute to the shared notes or code snippets.

### Markdown Support

Wipsy supports Markdown syntax, allowing you to format your text with headings, lists, bold, italics, and more. Simply use the standard Markdown syntax while typing in the input field.

### Code Blocks

To create code blocks, surround your code with triple backticks (```) followed by the language extension. For example:
##### ```js <-(your code file extension)
##### // your code goes here
##### ```

### Image Upload

You can upload images directly into the input field by pasting the image content or using the built-in file upload functionality.

## Future Goals

- **File Upload**: Enhance Wipsy by adding the ability to upload and share various file types, such as documents, presentations, or spreadsheets.
- **Collaboration Features**: Implement real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to simultaneously edit and contribute to the same chat or notes.
- **Customization Options**: Introduce customization options for chat appearance, themes, and personalization.
- **Integration with Existing Tools**: Explore integration with popular educational or productivity tools to seamlessly incorporate Wipsy into existing workflows.
